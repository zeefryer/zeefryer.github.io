# Zee Fryer


I'm a mathematician-turned-ML-practicioner based in the Bay Area. I'm interested in AI fairness and applications of machine learning for social good.

In my free time I do long-distance running and aerial silks, try to teach my Roomba new tricks, and cater to the whims of my two demanding but very perfect cats.

## Quick Links

- Here is my [resume](/files/resume_zeefryer.pdf) and my [academic CV](/files/CV2019.pdf).
- You can find out more about my math research on the [Math Research](/math-research/) page.
- Here is my [Github](https://github.com/zeefryer), although it's a bit bare since most of what I worked on at Google isn't public. You can find a few samples of code I wrote at Google [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/commit/eb2b142f26e39aac1dcbb768417465ae9d4e5af6) and [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graph_compression/contrastive_learning/learning_latents).
